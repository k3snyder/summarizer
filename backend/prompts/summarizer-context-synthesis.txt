<instructions>
You are given page content from a document containing text, visual extractions, and tables. Your task is to synthesize ALL information into a comprehensive, structured representation that captures every detail for knowledge base indexing.
</instructions>

<approach>
1. INVENTORY: List every entity, concept, fact, and data point from all sources
2. DEDUPLICATE: Merge overlapping information, keeping the most detailed version
3. STRUCTURE: Organize into logical categories
4. CONNECT: Note explicit relationships between entities
5. OUTPUT: Produce a comprehensive synthesis that loses NO information
</approach>

<input_sources>
Your context contains information from multiple sources:
- **TEXT**: Extracted text from the document page
- **VISUAL**: Extracted visual elements (diagrams, charts, annotations, callouts)
- **TABLES**: Structured tabular data

Each source may contain unique information. Your synthesis must capture ALL of it.

## ENTITIES & ACTORS
[List every named entity: companies, products, people, services, technologies]
| Entity | Type | Description/Context |
|--------|------|---------------------|
| [name] | [company/product/person/service/tech] | [what we know about it] |

## KEY FACTS & CLAIMS
[Every factual statement, organized by category]

### Features & Capabilities
- [Fact 1]
- [Fact 2]

### Technical Details
- [Architecture, integrations, specifications]

### Security & Compliance
- [Security measures, compliance notes, data handling]

### Relationships & Dependencies
- [How entities relate: uses, depends on, integrates with]

## DATA POINTS
[All numerical data, statistics, measurements]
| Value | Context | Source |
|-------|---------|--------|
| [number/percentage] | [what it represents] | [text/visual/table] |

## VISUAL INFORMATION
[Information ONLY available from visual extraction - not in text]
- **Architecture/Flow**: [system flows, process steps]
- **Annotations**: [callouts, notes, disclaimers from diagrams]
- **Legend/Key**: [meanings of visual symbols]

## EXPLICIT CONNECTIONS
[Relationships stated in the content]
- [Entity A] → [relationship] → [Entity B]
- [Concept X] enables/requires/depends on [Concept Y]

## SOURCE COVERAGE
- Text contributed: [brief note on what text provided]
- Visual contributed: [brief note on unique visual information]
- Tables contributed: [brief note on tabular data]
</output_format>

<critical_rules>
1. **CAPTURE EVERYTHING**: Every fact, name, number, and relationship must appear
2. **PRESERVE SPECIFICITY**: "Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service" not just "Azure"
3. **MARK VISUAL-ONLY**: Flag information that ONLY came from visual extraction
4. **NO INTERPRETATION**: Report what's stated, don't infer unstated conclusions
5. **VERBATIM QUOTES**: For important statements, preserve exact wording
</critical_rules>
