<instructions>
You are given 3 independent vision extractions from the same document page image. Your task is to synthesize these into a single, comprehensive extraction that captures ALL details from all 3 sources while eliminating duplicates.
</instructions>

<approach>
1. COMPARE: Identify common elements across all 3 extractions
2. MERGE: Combine unique details from each extraction
3. RESOLVE: Handle conflicting values by noting the conflict or choosing the most detailed
4. VERIFY: Ensure the final output includes everything found across all 3 extractions
5. OUTPUT: Structure results in the standard extraction format
</approach>

<guardrails>
- Include ALL unique details from each extraction - do not lose any information
- When extractions agree, use the most complete/detailed version
- When extractions conflict on values, use [CONFLICTING: E1=$X, E2=$Y, E3=$Z] format
- If only one extraction captured something, include it (single extractors may catch details others miss)
- Maintain the exact output format from the original extractions
</guardrails>

<synthesis_rules>
1. **UNION OF FINDINGS**: The synthesized output should be a UNION of all findings, not an intersection
2. **DETAIL PRESERVATION**: If Extraction 2 has more detail than Extraction 1 for the same element, use Extraction 2's version
3. **CONFLICT MARKING**: Only mark conflicts when values genuinely differ (e.g., "$42M" vs "$43M"), not when one is more specific
4. **COVERAGE NOTES**: In the Verification section, note which extractions contributed to each major finding
</synthesis_rules>

<input_format>
You will receive 3 extractions in this format:

## EXTRACTION 1
[Full markdown extraction output]

## EXTRACTION 2
[Full markdown extraction output]

## EXTRACTION 3
[Full markdown extraction output]
</input_format>

<output_format>
Produce a single synthesized extraction following the EXACT same format as the input extractions:

## Visual Elements Detected
[Combined list of all element types found across all 3 extractions]

## Charts & Data Visualizations
[Merged chart data - use most detailed version, note conflicts]

## Tables
[Merged table data]

## Diagrams & Flowcharts
[Merged diagram data - union of all nodes and edges found]

## Images & Graphical Elements
[Merged image descriptions]

## Numeric Data
[Union of all numeric values found]

## Verification
- Synthesis source: Combined from 3 extractions
- Agreement: [X] elements found by all 3, [Y] by 2, [Z] by 1 only
- Conflicts resolved: [list any CONFLICTING markers]
- Coverage: Most comprehensive extraction was E[1/2/3] with [description]
</output_format>

<critical_rules>
1. **NEVER LOSE DATA**: Every piece of information from any extraction must appear in the synthesis
2. **PRESERVE STRUCTURE**: Keep the same markdown structure and table formats
3. **MARK SOURCES**: In Verification, note which extractions contributed key findings
4. **CONFLICT TRANSPARENCY**: Make value conflicts visible, don't silently pick one
5. **COMPLETENESS OVER BREVITY**: A longer, complete synthesis is better than a shorter one that loses details
</critical_rules>

<final_constraint>
OUTPUT ONLY the synthesized structured markdown. No conversational text, apologies, or explanations outside the specified sections.
