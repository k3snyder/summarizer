<instructions>
Analyze this document page image and extract ALL visual information that would not be captured by standard text extraction.
</instructions>

<approach>
1. SCAN: Identify what visual element types exist (charts, diagrams, tables, images)
2. EXTRACT: Pull exact values, labels, ALL text verbatim - including text boxes, callouts, legends, annotations, and notes within diagrams
3. VERIFY: Confirm each extraction is actually visible
4. RE-SCAN DIAGRAMS: Look again specifically for text boxes, callout annotations, legend items, and step descriptions - these are commonly missed
5. OUTPUT: Structure results in the format below
</approach>

<guardrails>
- Extract ONLY what is explicitly visible. NEVER interpolate or guess.
- If unclear, mark as [UNCLEAR: ~estimate] or omit entirely.
- Include missing/absent data as null, not fabricated values.
- Do not guess counts before observing. List items first, then count.
</guardrails>

Provide your response as structured Markdown with the following sections. If a section has no content, write "None detected."

## Visual Elements Summary
[Brief overview of visual content types found on this page]

## Charts & Data Visualizations
[For each chart/graph found, provide:]
- **Type**: [bar chart, line graph, pie chart, scatter plot, histogram, etc.]
- **Title**: [chart title if visible]
- **Axes**: [X-axis label/range, Y-axis label/range]
- **Data Points**: [specific numerical values, trends, patterns]
- **Legend**: [legend items and their color/symbol meanings]
- **Key Insights**: [notable trends, outliers, comparisons, peak values]

**Text Annotations & Callouts:**
- **Callout boxes**: "[exact text from any callout or annotation box]"
- **Legend items**: "[text next to any icon or symbol in the legend]"
- **Notes/Disclaimers**: "[any footnotes or disclaimers within the diagram]"
- **Step descriptions**: "1. [first step text]", "2. [second step text]"

## Tables with Visual Formatting
[For each table, describe:]
- **Structure**: [rows x columns, column headers, row headers]
- **Visual Elements**: [background colors, text highlights, borders, merged cells]
- **Numeric Data**: [extract precise values from important cells]
- **Visual Hierarchy**: [emphasized rows/columns, color coding schemes]
- **Notable Patterns**: [sorted data, grouped sections, totals/subtotals]

## Diagrams & Flowcharts
[For each diagram, describe:]
- **Type**: [flowchart, process diagram, network diagram, org chart, Venn diagram, etc.]
- **Components**: [boxes, shapes, nodes with their exact text labels]
- **Connections**: [arrows, lines, flow direction, relationship types]
- **Relationships**: [how elements connect, dependencies, hierarchies]
- **Decision Points**: [branching logic, conditions, outcomes]

## Images & Graphical Elements
- **Photos/Illustrations**: [describe subject matter, context, relevance]
- **Logos/Icons**: [identify company/brand logos, symbolic icons]
- **Annotations**: [handwritten notes, highlights, underlining, stamps]
- **Layout Elements**: [colored headers, sidebars, callout boxes, dividers, borders]
- **Visual Emphasis**: [bolded sections, boxed content, shaded areas]

## Numeric & Statistical Data
[Extract all visible numbers, being PRECISE:]
- **Percentages**: [e.g., "23.5%", "91%"]
- **Currency/Amounts**: [e.g., "$42,500", "€1.2M"]
- **Measurements**: [e.g., "150 km", "5.2 kg", "98°F"]
- **Statistics**: [mean, median, counts, ratios]
- **Dates/Times**: [specific dates, time periods, quarters]
- **Ranges**: [e.g., "15-20%", "Q1-Q3 2024"]

## Data Quality Notes
[CRITICAL - Be explicit about uncertainty:]
- **Unclear/Blurry Areas**: [describe what content is uncertain - DO NOT GUESS OR HALLUCINATE]
- **Partial Information**: [note if data appears cut off, cropped, or incomplete]
- **Low Confidence Extractions**: [mark any uncertain values with [UNCLEAR: ~approximate value]]
- **Missing Context**: [note if labels/legends are cut off or missing]

**CRITICAL EXTRACTION RULES:**

1. **Be Specific, Not Generic**: Extract EXACT values, not descriptions
   - ✅ GOOD: "Q1 Sales: $42,500, Q2 Sales: $51,200"
   - ❌ BAD: "Sales data showing growth trend"

2. **Preserve Exact Numbers**: For charts/tables, provide PRECISE values or clearly marked estimates
   - ✅ GOOD: "January: 23%, February: 31%, March: 28%"
   - ✅ ACCEPTABLE: "January: [UNCLEAR: ~20-25%]" (if blurry)
   - ❌ BAD: "increasing trend across months"

3. **Never Hallucinate**: If text/numbers are unclear, blurry, or missing, explicitly state this
   - ✅ GOOD: "[UNCLEAR: value appears to be ~XX but image is blurry]"
   - ❌ BAD: Making up plausible-looking numbers

4. **Preserve Original Wording**: Use exact labels, titles, legends as they appear
   - Don't paraphrase or interpret - copy verbatim

5. **Use Structured Format**: Organize with bullet points, numbered lists, tables within Markdown

6. **No Interpretation Beyond Visual**: Report what is visible, not what it might mean
   - ✅ GOOD: "Red line shows 15% increase from Q1 to Q2"
   - ❌ BAD: "Company is performing well" (interpretation)

7. **Handle Text-Only Pages**: If the page contains no significant visual elements beyond plain text, respond ONLY with:

**No significant visual elements detected.**

**DO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING ELSE** beyond the structured markdown format above. Do not add conversational text, apologies, or explanations outside the specified sections.
