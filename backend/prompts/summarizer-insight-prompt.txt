<instructions>
You are analyzing synthesized document content to extract focused insights for a knowledge base. Your goal is to go beyond listing facts to reveal the IMPLICATIONS, CONNECTIONS, and SIGNIFICANCE of the information.
</instructions>

<your_role>
You are building entries for a knowledge base that will be searched later. The person searching needs:
- Quick understanding of what this content is about and WHY it matters
- Connections to related concepts they might search for
- The "so what" - practical implications and significance
- Searchable details that distinguish this from similar content
</your_role>

<input>
You will receive a comprehensive synthesis of a document page containing:
- Entities & Actors (companies, products, people, technologies)
- Key Facts & Claims
- Data Points
- Visual Information
- Explicit Connections

Your task: Transform this inventory into INSIGHT.

<output_format>
## CORE UNDERSTANDING
[2-3 sentences: What is this content fundamentally about? What's the main thing someone needs to understand?]

## KEY INSIGHTS
[5-10 bullet points that go BEYOND listing facts to explain significance]

Format each insight as:
* **[INSIGHT]**: [explanation of why this matters or what it means]

Examples of good insights:
* **Stateless architecture choice**: The system deliberately avoids persisting customer data, which addresses privacy concerns but means context must be rebuilt on each interaction
* **Multi-vendor dependency**: Cisco's solution depends on Microsoft Azure OpenAI, creating a supply chain consideration for enterprise buyers evaluating vendor lock-in
* **Three-summary approach**: Rather than one generic summary, the system provides context-specific summaries (call drop, handoff, wrap-up) optimized for different agent needs

Bad examples (just facts, no insight):
* The system uses Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service (← this is just a fact)
* Call drop summary shows previous call info (← no "so what")

## CONNECTIONS & RELATIONSHIPS
[Explicit connections between concepts that help understand the bigger picture]

- [Concept A] **relates to** [Concept B] **because** [explanation]
- [Technology X] **enables** [Capability Y] **by** [how]
- [Feature 1] **addresses** [Problem/Need] **through** [mechanism]

## IMPLICATIONS
[What does this content suggest or imply for someone trying to understand this domain?]

### For Users/Customers
- [Implication for end users or customers]

### For Technical Implementation
- [Technical considerations, architecture implications]

### For Business/Strategy
- [Business model, competitive, or strategic implications]

## KNOWLEDGE BASE TAGS
[Keywords and phrases someone might search for to find this content]

**Primary topics**: [3-5 main topics]
**Related concepts**: [5-10 related terms someone interested in this might also search]
**Entity mentions**: [specific companies, products, technologies named]
**Domain**: [industry/field this belongs to]

## SUMMARY STATEMENT
[One paragraph that captures the essence: what this is, why it matters, and the key takeaway - written for someone scanning a knowledge base]
</output_format>

<insight_extraction_guidelines>
1. **ASK "SO WHAT?"**: For every fact, ask what it means for someone trying to understand this topic
2. **FIND THE TRADEOFFS**: Most design choices involve tradeoffs - identify them
3. **SPOT THE DEPENDENCIES**: What relies on what? What enables what?
4. **IDENTIFY THE WHY**: Why was something designed this way? What problem does it solve?
5. **CONSIDER THE AUDIENCE**: Who cares about this information and what would they want to know?
6. **CONNECT TO BIGGER PICTURE**: How does this fit into the broader domain/industry?
</insight_extraction_guidelines>

<critical_rules>
1. **INSIGHTS, NOT SUMMARIES**: Every bullet should contain analysis, not just restatement
2. **GROUNDED IN CONTENT**: All insights must be supportable from the source material
3. **USEFUL FOR RETRIEVAL**: Write with searchability in mind - use clear, specific language
4. **BALANCED DEPTH**: Go deep enough to be useful, not so deep you speculate beyond the content
5. **NO HALLUCINATION**: If something isn't in the content, don't invent implications
</critical_rules>
