<instructions>
You are given 3 independent summary note extractions from the same document page. Your task is to synthesize these into a single, comprehensive set of summary notes that captures ALL details from all 3 sources while eliminating duplicates.
</instructions>

<approach>
1. COMPARE: Identify common points across all 3 extractions
2. MERGE: Combine unique details from each extraction
3. DEDUPLICATE: Remove redundant points that say the same thing differently
4. RESOLVE: Handle conflicting values by noting the conflict or using the most detailed version
5. OUTPUT: Structure results as bullet points
</approach>

<guardrails>
- Include ALL unique information from each extraction - do not lose any details
- When extractions agree, use the most complete/detailed version
- When extractions conflict on values, use [CONFLICTING: E1=$X, E2=$Y, E3=$Z] format
- If only one extraction captured something, include it (single extractors may catch details others miss)
- Preserve exact names, companies, numbers, and statistics as they appear
- Maintain 5-15 bullet points total in the synthesized output
</guardrails>

<synthesis_rules>
1. **UNION OF FINDINGS**: The synthesized output should be a UNION of all findings, not an intersection
2. **DETAIL PRESERVATION**: If Extraction 2 has more detail than Extraction 1 for the same point, use Extraction 2's version
3. **CONFLICT MARKING**: Only mark conflicts when values genuinely differ (e.g., "$42M" vs "$43M"), not when one is more specific
4. **NUMERICAL ACCURACY**: All numbers, percentages, dates, and statistics must be preserved exactly
5. **NO FABRICATION**: Never add information not present in any of the 3 extractions
</synthesis_rules>

<input_format>
You will receive 3 extractions in this format:

## EXTRACTION 1
* [bullet point 1]
* [bullet point 2]
...

## EXTRACTION 2
* [bullet point 1]
* [bullet point 2]
...

## EXTRACTION 3
* [bullet point 1]
* [bullet point 2]
...
</input_format>

<output_format>
Format your synthesized summary as bullet points starting with * followed by a space:

* [First key point as a complete, accurate sentence]
* [Second key point as a complete, accurate sentence]
* [Continue with additional points as needed, typically 5-15 total]

Do not wrap the output in any XML tags. Just provide the bullet points directly.
</output_format>

<critical_rules>
1. **NEVER LOSE DATA**: Every unique piece of information from any extraction must appear in the synthesis
2. **PRESERVE NUMBERS**: All numerical data must be preserved exactly as stated
3. **CONFLICT TRANSPARENCY**: Make value conflicts visible, don't silently pick one
4. **COMPLETENESS OVER BREVITY**: A longer, complete synthesis is better than a shorter one that loses details
5. **NO EXPLANATIONS**: Output ONLY the bullet points, no preamble or commentary
</critical_rules>
